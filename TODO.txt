V25.01.0 (0/12 realized):
=========================
- Fix treating single line editables as multiline when trying to detect end of a document
- Consider changing int fields like for tone durations in settings panel to sliders or combos so that immediate effect can be implemented safely for these fields
- Add immediate effect to volume changes in settings panel so users can hear it right away
- Consider fixing checkboxes and other selections in settings panel staying in effect even after Cancel is chosen
- Change settings panel by using more API methods to notify users about wrong input instead of just ignoring it or make it completely impossible to enter
- Try to improve caret reporting at the end of documents some more
- See about getting the font size and using it to improve caret tone positioning
: Delete and backspace consider as typing unless selection was removed
  (selection bit not implemented yet)
- Change the ancestor reporting request algorithm
- Implement requestable location report stretching for a caret position in text editables
  that is, enable users to hear the caret position in full pitch range regardless the actual caret position on the screen
  so that the relation of the caret position to the size of the editable is felt
  this may help those with less sensitive hearing to use the caret position reporting effectively
  (consider implementing this for all objects instead, i.e. allow per client reporting)
- Add laptop gestures per issue request
- Either translate the addon to other languages by myself or introduce it to translation system

V24.07.0 (3/13 realized):
=========================
+ Implement installTasks.py to preserve settings after update from 24.05 and later
+ Flip settings panel sliders to lower with downarrow
+ Implement possibility of changing caret position reporting behaviour (no reporting, reporting only lines, reporting only rows, reporting lines and rows)
- Consider fixing checkboxes in settings panel staying in effect even after Cancel is chosen
- Add laptop gestures per issue request
- Change settings panel by using more API methods to notify users about wrong input instead of just ignoring it

V24.06.3 (6/12 realized):
=========================
+ Switch from print() function to logHandler module for warnings
- Fix treating single line editables as multiline when trying to detect end of a document
- See about getting the font size and using it to improve caret tone positioning
- Try to improve caret reporting at the end of documents some more

+ Implement translations and put all translatable messages into a separate module
+ Implement configuration saving
+ Implement settings panel
+ Update the add-on template to a new version
+ Consider backward compatibility (at least back to NVDA 2022.4
  * Considered!!! 2023.1 stays.
