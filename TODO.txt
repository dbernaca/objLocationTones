V2024.06.0 (2/12 realized):
===========================
- Switch from print() function to logHandler module for warnings
- Fix treating single line editables as multiline when trying to detect end of a document
- See about getting the font size and using it to improve caret tone positioning
- Try to improve caret reporting at the end of documents some more
: Delete and backspace consider as typing unless selection was removed
  (selection bit not implemented yet)
- Change the ancestor reporting request algorithm
- Implement requestable location report stretching for a caret position in text editables
  that is, enable users to hear the caret position in full pitch range regardless the actual caret position on the screen
  so that the relation of the caret position to the size of the editable is felt
  this may help those with less sensitive hearing to use the caret position reporting effectively
  (consider implementing this for all objects instead, i.e. allow per client reporting)
+ Implement translations and put all translatable messages into a separate module
+ Implement configuration saving
- Implement settings panel
- Update the add-on template to a new version
- Consider backward compatibility (at least back to NVDA 2022.4
